	title = Suborbital Thermosphere Research
	genericTitle = Suborbital Thermosphere Research
	description = The thermosphere is the layer of Earth's atmosphere controlled by atmospheric tides and solar activity which spans roughly from 120 to 600 km altitude. In this region, atmospheric particles are electrically charged and heated by highly energetic solar radiation. Scientists have never had direct access to the thermosphere before, and are eager to collect atmospheric data. Design, build and launch a scientific sounding rocket that will send scientific instruments and @payload units of meteorological payload to @altitude km.<br><b>Make sure your rocket contains a thermometer and barometer as we will need science returned. In the case that you have already completed these experiments, you will need to force run them. This can be done by clicking on the science part and then the info button.</b><br>This is a series of six contracts, of which @index have been completed. This series will require a maximum altitude of 600 km.
	genericDescription = Deliver a meteorological payload to a specified altitude.
	synopsis = Launch a sounding rocket with @payload units of meteorological payload to @altitude km.
	completedMessage = Congratulations on a successful launch! The rocket has delivered the payload.
