	title = Low Space Biological Experimentation
	genericTitle = Low Space Biological Experimentation
	description = Launching small mammals will prepare us for the monumental task of putting an astronaut into space. Carry a small biological capsule and @payload units of monitoring gear and instrumentation into low space, then recover the experiment. You will need to stay above 140 km for at least a full minute to make and transmit the required observations before jettisoning the payload, if desired.<br>This is a series of four contracts, of which @index have been completed. After series completion, advanced biological sounding rocket and then crewed suborbital contracts will become available. This series will require a maximum payload of 120 units.
	genericDescription = Put a biological experiment and a scientific communications payload above 140 km for sixty seconds and recover the experiment and payload safely.
	synopsis = Launch and recover a biological capsule and @payload units of scientific communications equipment from over 140 km
	completedMessage = Well done! Our scientists are now studying the sample to see the effects of the journey.
